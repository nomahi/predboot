Description: A R package for computing optimism-corrected predictive accuracy measures for multivariable prediction models. It enables computations of the optimism-corrected C-statistics by bootstrap correction methods (Harrell, 0.632, and 0.632+ methods) by logistic regression models by ML, ridge, and lasso regressions. Also, it can compute bootstrap-based optimism-corrected confidence intervals for the predictive accuracy measures proposed by Noma et al. (2020). Other functions would be added if requested.
