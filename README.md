## Optimism-corrected predictive accuracy measures for multivariable prediction models

A R package for computations of optimism-corrected predictive accuracy measures for multivariable prediction models:

- Calculating optimism-corrected C-statistics by bootstrap correction methods (Harrell, 0.632, and 0.632+ methods)
- Constructiong multivariable prediction models by ML, ridge, and lasso regressions
- Computing bootstrap-based optimism-corrected confidence intervals for the predictive accuracy measures



## Installation

``` r
# Or the the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("predboot")
devtools::install_github("nomahi/predboot")
```
